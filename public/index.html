<p>Generative Design in Unity</p>

<p>What is this book?
This is book is an introduction to Generative Design or �Creative Coding� inside of Unity.</p>

<p>Why should you read this book?</p>

<p>What is Creative Coding?</p>

<pre><code>Creative Coding is kind of a weird term. As programming in general is about problem solving, any kind of coding requires creativity. Wether this is in the finance industries, industry automation, gaming or cutting-edge Artificial intelligence. Yet Creative Coding has been widely(quelle) adopted as a term for Artistic Works that are generated through Code.\
</code></pre>

<p>�Processing�?
Processing is one probably the most influential programming Framework for creative coding. Its has a very shallow learning curve and features many convenient shortcuts for creative coding while still maintaining the ability to create wonderful and complex artworks. With the addition of p5.js to the Processing family it is now running on a Javascript basis in the Webbrowser and can be used to amplify an website. While it also features support for WebGL, Processing and p5.js are not perfectly suited to support 3D.</p>

<p>�Why Unity?�
While Unity is NOT optimized for Creative Coding, and learning Coding for Unity MIGHT be a little harder than learning processing, most ideas are exactly the same. And while Unity WILL introduce more �clutter� into the journey to programming it also enables it�s users to do so much more.
Throughout this book we will discover, that while some �sketches� people created in Processing are really easy to recreate and extend, others are really quite hard to implement.</p>

<p>�Why Creative Coding?�</p>

<p>�But&hellip; Unreal?�
Unreal Engine is great! It looks stunning and the Blueprint System is a fantastic variant on Coding, this book is supposed to be about coding. Writing Code. And it is also for beginners who maybe do not want to end up with a career in programming specifically. This means C# is a gentler introduction to coding.</p>

<p>So you managed your way through the Introduction and are still here. Awesome!
The first step on your Journey to learn is to actually go and download Unity.
While you could just head to unity3d.com and grab the latest and greatest Version of Unity Personal, I would suggest getting the Unity Hub.
Unity Hub will help you manage your Projects as well as the Versions of Unity you have installed on your machine.
As you dive deeper and deeper into Unity the day will come, where you hear of a new feature and you really want to try it.
And Unity Hub is great helper to automatically manage Versions of Unity! But both ways are obviously fine!</p>

<p>As you are willing to learn to code and coding is in essence a problem solving skill, I will leave the rest of the process to you.
If you struggle, from now on and for the rest of this journey the Search-Engine of your choice is your best friend!</p>

<p>Now that we are set up and have a very rough overview over the editor we should finally get moving!
So first we need something, that we can indeed move around! How about a Sphere? Spheres are awesome! Everyone loves Spheres! There are several ways to create Geometry inside Unity but the most convenient is to do a �right-click� in the hierarchy and select �3D-Objects/Sphere�.
Now you should see a Sphere inside your Editor view as well as the Gameview, if you haven�t messed to heavily with your Camera. This Sphere is a �GameObject�.
If you select your sphere and take a look at the inspector on the right side, you will see the name correspond to the object in the Hierarchy.
Below you will find five �Components� attached to the GameObject. We are interested into the Transform Component, as we are willing to actually move the Object. You can hover your mouse over the Letters �XYZ� and you actually get a slider Control to move, rotate or scale the object! Go ahead try it! When you are done set reset the values to 0 on Position and Rotation and to 1 on the Scale values.
Ok that is fancy and all, but gets a little tedious to do, so let�s get this thing moving on it�s own. To do this we need another Component. So click the �Add Component� Button in the Inspector. This will offer you a list of all the Components Unity offers. Don�t bother with it and just type a name like �Movement�. Every name that is not already in use by Unity itself is fine and Unity will offer you to create a new script. Choose that Option to an Choose create and add.
This will create an Script in the AssetFolder. You can now either do a double-click on the Name of the Script on the Script Component or in the Asset Folder in the Project View.
This will trigger your default ScriptEditor/IDE to open up. Most likely Visual Studio Code. This can vary on Version of Unity and wether you are on Mac, PC or Linux. It does not matter though. You could do all of this using notepad or textedit. It�s just more Convenient to use an IDE like Visual Studio.
Now when Visual Studio Code pops up you will have your first Script and it already has Code! That�s �boilerplate� Code Unity provides you with, because it assumes a that you are going to need a few things anyways. DON�T be intimidated by anything here. We will break it all down into pieces and for now we are just interested in the Update part.</p>

<p>// Update is called once per frame?void Update()?{?    ?}</p>

<p>The fine people at unity actually added a comment for us. �// Update is called once per frame�
So now we know that what ever we do in Update is called every frame. The perfect place to add code for movement!</p>

<p>void Update()?{?    transform.position = transform.position + new Vector3(1, 0, 0);?}</p>

<p>If we add this Code inside the Curly brackets of the Update() Method and start Play Mode (CTRL+P in Unity) our Sphere starts moving. If you try this it will probably move so fast its pretty much instantly gone into the distance, but we will fix that later. Lets first inspect that line of code.
On the left side of the statement we have transform.position. If you take a look at the Inspector in Unity our GameObject has a �Transform� Component. In that Component the first set of values is the position values. This �dot notation� in C# is like referencing the hierarchy. We first select the transform Component and then separated by the dot the subcomponent Position.
On the right side we repeat transform.position, which means we take the current value of transform and then add a new Vector3 to it. Our position in 3D consists of 3 values: x,y,z. Unity does not allow us to just change one value, so we need a Vector with three components as well. We have to create it using the new Keyword and give it values. We just want it to move along one Axis.</p>

<p>So you probably saw your Sphere shoot of to never be seen again. So let�s think about what is happening. Let�s assume our Sphere is at the center of our scene in the beginning. The we start Play Mode and our Script kicks in. It takes our current Position add 1 on the X-Axis. This happens every single Frame. Unity  aims for a framerate of 60 Frames per Second. Our Sphere is thus moving at 60m/s or 216km/h. That�s fast!
So we need to slow it down:</p>

<p>void Update()?{?    transform.position = transform.position + new Vector3(1, 0, 0) * Time.deltaTime;?}</p>

<p>If you try that code your Sphere is way slower. So what does this mystical Time.deltaTime do?
Time.deltaTime is the amount of time Unity took to calculate the last Frame. So probably about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>60</sub>. If you multiply this with the amount we want to move we actually get a movement of 1m/s. Exactly the amount we added. So pretty much whenever you want to move stuff you need to multiply the movement by Time.deltaTime.</p>

<p>Why does Unity know to move our Sphere? Because it is attached to our GameObject and Unity uses a shorthand to understand whats going on. You could go with a longer Code and add �this.gameObject� in front. This would be more specific, but would also mean more clutter in your code. If you write code that is unnecessary your IDE will probably give you a hint about that. Most likely by coloring the Code gray.</p>

<p>void Update()?{?    this.gameObject.transform.Translate(Vector3.right);?}</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have written your first script! Next we will take a look at the Console - your new best friend while Coding!</p>

<p>** You can also create the Script in the ProjectView and go �RightClick/Create/C# Script�</p>

<p>** You will probably find these:
Transform, *(MeshFilter), Mesh Renderer, Sphere Collider and a Default Material. You can probably guess what each Component does:
The Material Component defines what kind of �Material� your GameObject is supposed to be made of. Or what it should it look like.
The Mesh Renderer than defines how it is drawn to the screen. The Mesh Filter deals with shape of the GameObject and the Sphere Collider</p>

<p>TLDR;
- Create a Sphere
- Add a Script Component to that sphere.
- On Update add a Vector3 to your transform.position
- multiply it by Time.deltaTime to get more reasonable timing.</p>

<p>Maybe you have already encountered the console. Whenever you write code your computer does not understand it will tell you so in the console. And as we are Coding in C#  your computer will be very picky about the code you write! If you havnt, go ahead an fabricate an error!</p>

<p>transform.position = transform.positio + new Vector3(1, 0, 0) * Time.deltaTime;</p>

<p>What�s important to note here is, that this never means that you have failed, it�s just, your computer making absolutely sure you are both talking about the same thing! It�s like giving a friend directions over the phone and the connection is bad, so he has to ask again because he didn�t get the message completely.
The good thing on the other hand is, that he will always tell you where he has problems understanding you. If you look at an error message in the console you will see the Script that is causing the error first and in brackets two numbers. The first one indicates the line on which he has trouble understanding you, the next number is the actual character! Now that specific! But better yet! Double-Clicking on the error message will take you directly to the line of Code in your editor. In most cases your IDE will also try to highlight the code it thinks is wrong.</p>

<p>So now that we have established that the console is our friend and not our enemy, let�s take a</p>

<p>So now that we have established that the console is our friend and not our enemy, let�s take a how it can help is even more.</p>

<p>Often in programming we think about what we want to achieve and yet the computer does not what we want him to. Especially as a beginner we often assume the computer knows something it doesn�t. So we can actually ask the Computer to tell us what he thinks is going on. For example asking the Computer to tell is the position of our sphere every frame:</p>

<p>Debug.Log(transform.position.x);</p>

<p>The Debug.Log() function prints whatever you give it to the Console. In this case we again ask for the transform Component of our gameObject, go one step deeper for the position and another step to just ask for the x Component.</p>

<p>Now that we are able to get any miscommunication out of the way. Let�s get back to moving things. Preferably by getting input from the user. This will not only help your journey in creative coding but will also enable you to write simple games. Which is great fun too!
So how would we think of this if we could talk to the computer naturally? Maybe would say something like this:
�If somebody presses right on the Keyboard, move the sphere left.�
Simple enough and yet we just also introduced if-statements. Which is great, because they enabled is to do so much more!</p>

<p>if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.RightArrow))?{?    transform.position = transform.position + new Vector3(1, 0, 0) * Time.deltaTime;?}</p>

<p>Take a look at that code. You should recognize a lot of that code from the first chapter, because it�s identical. The �if� introduces an �if-statement�. It is followed by condition in brackets. The Condition in this case is true if the RightArrow Key is pressed down.
The if condition is followed by opening curly brackets. Hereafter comes the closing curly brackets. Simplified code could look like this:</p>

<p>If(Condition is true){
    Code run when true
}</p>

<p>So the last thing we need to look at is the condition.</p>

<p>Before we move forward I�d like you to install a Unity package written for this book. The �Puny� Package is trying to mimick some processing functionality  inside unity. The main idea here is to be able to still focus on coding, yet also advance our visual output.
If you want to know what is happening under the hood you can always take a look at the files. There is no magic involved. And if you find code I could improve, let me know!</p>

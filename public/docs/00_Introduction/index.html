<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<h3 id="what-is-this-book">What is this book?</h3>

<p>The core idea of this book is teaching Unity as a tool for creative people of all kinds. This is a “living” book. It means things will change, parts will grow, others will wither. This is for multiple reasons. For one, I am not an expert on all topics in Unity, I guess one can’t be. I have a background in Media-Design and am trying to learn and in this case teach Unity to the best of my ability. This means that if you find errors, tell me and I will try to fix them. Unity and its programming language C#, are living things. Unity releases new Versions three times a year, if you count in betas and package updates, then a lot of change is happening all the time. So best practices can change and I will do my best to maintain these changes in this book. As of now, all of this will be up-to-date with the Unity 2019.4 LTS (long-term support) version.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this book I will teach Unity and C# using “creative coding” or “Generative Design”. I will start with coding, because no matter what you want to do with it, the sooner you become familiar with the coding bits, the easier the rest of it will become. While Unity has many uses (see further down) most of them will require you to know aspects of the software. So while a simple game like “Block Breaker” or “Asteroids” may not be too hard to clone, you have to deal with several aspects when putting it all together. Think: User Input, Graphics, User Interface, Sound, etc.. While “Creative Coding” can get very complex, we can isolate ideas and try to be creative with them in isolation. This helps to build mileage and gives us the opportunity to take a step back and think about our visual output.
With “Creative Coding” we will look at the things you would see from people learning or using Processing. While Processing is great and I encourage anyone to look into it, Unity gives us more possibilities. Processing relies on programming for creating output, we will make use of the added tools Unity provides. This can overwhelm in the beginning, yet I assure you that most of the tools simplify our lives.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-this-for">Who is this for?</h3>

<p>In this book I will assume that you have no knowledge of game engines, 3D or programming. If you do, try to start at a point that seems to be the end of your current knowledge.
Working with game engines often requires you to have access to 3D models which are created in other software. I can’t go over showing you how to create them in this book, but will provide you all the models you need to follow the book.
You can also find many, many models for free or for cheap in the Unity Asset store.</p>

<p>### What is “Creative Coding”?
Creative Coding is a somewhat weird term. As programming is problem solving, any coding requires creativity. Whether in the finance industries, industry automation, gaming or innovative Artificial intelligence projects. Yet “Creative Coding” is widely adopted as a term for artworks created through code.
As mentioned before, we will stretch this term a little and will not only rely on code to create our works, but will also use the editor tools.</p>

<h3 id="processing">“Processing”?</h3>

<p>Processing is the most influential programming Framework for creative coding. It has a very shallow learning curve and features many convenient shortcuts for creative coding while still maintaining the ability to create wonderful and complex artworks. With the addition of p5.js to the Processing family it is now running on a Javascript basis in the Web browser and is used to build lively and reactive websites. While Processing has capabilities to create 3D projects, Unity will outshine Processing in this area by a large margin.</p>

<h3 id="why-unity">“Why Unity?”</h3>

<p>While Unity is not optimized for Creative Coding, and learning to code for Unity might be harder than learning &ldquo;Processing”, most ideas are the same. And while Unity will introduce more “clutter” into the journey to programming it enables its users to do so much more. It includes a full-featured 3D Engine and even AI Tools. But even more: C# - The programming language used to code - is very, very versatile. With it you can write native applications for Windows, Linux and Mac and Apps for iOS or Android.
I think Unity is a great place to learn to code for “creatives”.</p>

<h3 id="but-unreal-engine">“But&hellip; Unreal Engine?”</h3>

<p>Unreal Engine is a fantastic 3D render engine, and now more and more widely adapted in many industries, as is Unity. But programming in Unreal is hard, because the underlying language is “C++”. While there are many, many similarities between both languages, “C#” handles the more tedious and complex programming tasks for us. If you reach a point where you know C# well, switching to C++ won’t be that hard any more. Thus you won’t be making a mistake starting here.
That said, if you know you want to become a programmer for absolute high-end experiences, and be part of a larger team I suggest looking straight at C++ and Unreal Engine. Though I think the margin between both is negligible when you are just starting out.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-read-this-book">How to read this book</h3>

<p>While reading fiction is very much straight forward, reading books that aim to teach something, can be challenging. I’d encourage you to read through each chapter as a whole and try to understand the concept that is discussed. Then try it out yourself.
While I suggest reading the first ten chapters in order, you can take more freedoms after that. It will occur that the chapters are tightly entwined in their topics. If I introduce concepts relevant chapters in different chapters, I will try to always link you to the according passages.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-code">A note on code</h3>

<p>If you are an absolute beginner, you might feel that there is a lot going on even in the first chapters. Bear with me. Ignore the aspects of the code you don’t understand and focus on the topics discussed in the chapter. Just copy the rest of the code. By the end of Chapter 9 you should be comfortable understanding all of these things. Just roll with it.
On the other side, if you are already versed in a different programming language and think some code examples are messy. And with each concept introduced I try to end up with more readable code and well structured code. But all example have to be well understandable for people just starting out.</p>

<p>Throughout this book we will approach programming through examples as well as tiny projects to test and apply your knowledge. If you are already completely comfortable with a topic, feel free to skip it and go back to it if need be.
The idea behind projects is: Programming is a craft. Many ideas are easy to grasp while reading them, but actually applying them is something different. There is a kind of muscle memory you have to build up. If you have to think about how to write a “if-block”, you lose time to actually think about the higher-level problem. So use these exercises to get up to speed with programming. It will also offer you the chance to try many creative approaches.</p>

<p>With all of this out of the way. Let’s go! I hope you enjoy the ride!</p>

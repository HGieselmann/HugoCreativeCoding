Author:</p>

<p>Generative Design in Unity</p>

<p>What is this book?
This is book is an introduction to Generative Design or “Creative Coding” inside of Unity.</p>

<p>Why should you read this book?</p>

<p>What is Creative Coding?
Creative Coding is kind of a weird term. As programming in general is about problem solving, any kind of coding requires creativity. Wether this is in the finance industries, industry automation, gaming or cutting-edge Artificial intelligence. Yet Creative Coding has been widely(quelle) adopted as a term for Artistic Works that are generated through Code.</p>

<p>“Processing”?
Processing is one probably the most influential programming Framework for creative coding. Its has a very shallow learning curve and features many convenient shortcuts for creative coding while still maintaining the ability to create wonderful and complex artworks. With the addition of p5.js to the Processing family it is now running on a Javascript basis in the Webbrowser and can be used to amplify an website. While it also features support for WebGL, Processing and p5.js are not perfectly suited to support 3D.</p>

<p>“Why Unity?”
While Unity is NOT optimized for Creative Coding, and learning Coding for Unity MIGHT be a little harder than learning processing, most ideas are exactly the same. And while Unity WILL introduce more “clutter” into the journey to programming it also enables it’s users to do so much more.
Throughout this book we will discover, that while some “sketches” people created in Processing are really easy to recreate and extend, others are really quite hard to implement.</p>

<p>“Why Creative Coding?”</p>

<p>“But&hellip; Unreal?”
Unreal Engine is great! It looks stunning and the Blueprint System is a fantastic variant on Coding, this book is supposed to be about coding. Writing Code. And it is also for beginners who maybe do not want to end up with a career in programming specifically. This means C# is a gentler introduction to coding.</p>
